<p>Before coming to KCL in I had postdocs at the University of Vienna (2025), the University of Sheffield (2022-2025), and Washington University in St. Louis (2021-2022). I did my PhD (2021) at UT Austin with Josh Dever and Mark Sainsbury. My dissertation was about communication and rationality.</p>
  
<p>Currently (Autumn 2025) I'm working on a paper about the nature of learning, and specifically the difference between rational learning and arational attitude change (r&r at <i>Mind</i>); I'm also writing a survey article about speech acts and rational attitude change for <i>Philosophy Compass</i>. Right now I have papers under review about the function of folk psychology (r&r at <i>Mind and Language</i>), the rationality of hoarding rather than updating on information you learn (with Jake Quilty-Dunn), and how we acquire knowledge of rules in pedagogical contexts (with Shaun Nichols).</p>
