<p><b>About me.</b></p>
<p>I'm interested in lots of questions about the relationship between language, cognition, and motivation.</p>

<p>Before coming to Sheffield I was a McDonnell postdoctoral fellow in Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis. I did my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Josh Dever and Mark Sainsbury.</p>

<p>Below you'll find information about some of my current research projects as well as a list of my publications. You can reach me by email at h.ianschiller [at] sheffield.ac.uk.</p>

<p><b>Series of papers on desire / deisre satisfaction.</b></p>
<p>In this series of papers (the culmination of my Leverhulme project) I try to set the record straight on the relationship between our motivations and our representations of what we want, and the importance of each of these things to interpersonal interactions.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Wanting Brought to an End.</i></li>
<li><i>The Psychopragmatics of Desire.</i></li>
<li><i>Advocacy and the Function of Folk Psychology.</i></li>
</ol>
