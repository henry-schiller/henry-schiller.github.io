<p><b>About me.</b></p>
<p>I'm interested in all sorts of questions about how our minds can change and how we can change each other's minds. My work sits somewhere at the intersection of philosophy of mind / cognitive science, philosophy of language, social epistemology, and moral psychology.</p>
  
<p></p>Currently, one of my main projects is about how we form and relate to personal narratives, and the role that these play in interpersonal ethics. I also have ongoing projects about the function of attitude verbs, the nature of learning and interpersonal communication, practical language (threats, commands, etc.), and the relationship between folk psychology and scientific theories of the mind. I am the Speech Acts area editor for PhilPapers.</p>

<p>Before coming to Vienna I was a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at the University of Sheffield, and before that a McDonnell postdoctoral fellow in Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis. I did my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Josh Dever and Mark Sainsbury.</p>
