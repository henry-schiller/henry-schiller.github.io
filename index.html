I am a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at the University of Sheffield.

<p><b>About me.</b></p>
<p>I'm interested in lots of questions about the relationship between language, cognition, and motivation.</p>

<p>Before coming to Sheffield I was a McDonnell postdoctoral fellow in Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis. I did my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Josh Dever and Mark Sainsbury. I've also had visiting appointments at The University of Antwerp (May 2023), the Pittsburgh Center for Philosophy of Science (Fall 2023) and the Human Abilities Centre (AY 2024-2025).</p>
