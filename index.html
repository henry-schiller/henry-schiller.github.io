<p><b>About me.</b></p>
<p>I'm interested in lots of different questions about the relationship between language, cognition, and motivation. You can read about some of my research projects and publications below.</p>

<p>Before coming to Sheffield I was a McDonnell postdoctoral fellow in Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis. I did my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Josh Dever and Mark Sainsbury.</p>

<p><b>Projects.</b></p>
<p>My current research can be divided into several different projects:</p>

<p><b>Linguistic Influence: Rational or Arational?</b></p>

<p>
We use language to influence others in countless ways—through threats, commands, or appeals to emotion. But how much of this influence is grounded in rational processes? My work explores the mental effects of speech acts, focusing on the tension between treating linguistic communication as a rational activity and the non-propositional nature of many linguistic forms (e.g., imperatives). This research raises questions about how language can shape attention, motivation, and action, and what responsibilities communicators bear in light of these effects.
</p>

<p><b> What Counts as Rational Learning?</b></p>
<p>
What distinguishes rational learning from other kinds of mental changes? My research examines this conceptual boundary and develops a theory of learning centered on information sensitivity and selection processes. I argue that rational learning involves comparisons and preferences that extend beyond belief or credence updates. By treating learning as a form of intrapersonal communication, I propose an externalist account that connects information possession to inquiry and decision-making.
</p>

<p><b>  Representing and Ascribing Desires</b></p>
<p>
How do we understand and represent our desires to ourselves and others? My research investigates how self-interpretation of mental states supports choice, communication, and moral reasoning. I examine whether “desire” refers to a unified propositional attitude or a hybrid concept capturing diverse phenomena. This inquiry has implications for the rational acquisition of desires and the function of folk psychological ascriptions in navigating our social and cognitive lives.
</p>  

  <p><b>Cognition and Normative Practices </b></p>

<p>What role do innate cognitive functions play in structuring our normative practices, like scientific inquiry? My work explores how constraints on rational choice—shaped by arationally acquired cognitive mechanisms—fix the domains over which we deliberate and quantify. These mechanisms, while ecologically rational, influence not only our reasoning but also our evaluative and pro-attitudes. </p>

 <p>One recurring theme of my research is to challenge and reframe assumptions about interpersonal differences, revealing surprising commonalities in how we think and value.</p>
