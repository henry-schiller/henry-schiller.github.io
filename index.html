<p>Before coming to KCL in I had postdocs at the University of Vienna, the University of Sheffield, and Washington University in St. Louis. I did my PhD at UT Austin with Josh Dever and Mark Sainsbury. My dissertation was about communication and rationality.</p>
  
<p>Right now I'm working on a paper about the difference between rational learning and arational attitude change (r&r at <i>Mind</i>) and I'm writing a survey article about speech acts and rational attitude change for <i>Philosophy Compass</i>.</p>
  
<p>I have papers under review about the function of folk psychology (r&r at <i>Mind and Language</i>), the rationality of hoarding rather than updating on information you learn (with Jake Quilty-Dunn), and the rational acquisition of social rules (with Shaun Nichols).</p>
